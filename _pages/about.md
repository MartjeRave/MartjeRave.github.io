Hello and welcome!

My name is Martje Rave, and I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Statistics at LMU Munich. I work at the Chair of Applied Statistics in the Social Sciences, Economics, and Business, led by Prof. Dr. Göran Kauermann, where I am involved in both research and teaching.<br>

My research focuses on exploratory and predictive modelling, with a particular interest in areal data analysis. Recently, I have been applying these methods to better understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team has contributed to public understanding through weekly pandemic reports, and I’ve supported the Bavarian Health Authority (LGL) in planning ICU occupancy across the state.<br>

Lately, I have been working on using advanced statistical models to impute missing data on ICU admissions, shedding light on patient pathways that were previously not publicly observed. These insights are helping us analyse trends in ICU length of stay and disease severity over time.<br>

In addition to my research, I teach regression methodology at both Bachelor’s and Master’s level, mainly using R. I also lead seminars exploring Open Science and advanced methods in areal data analysis.<br>
If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:martje.rave@stat.uni-muenchen.de) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martje-rave-822b5789/). I look forward to hearing from you!
